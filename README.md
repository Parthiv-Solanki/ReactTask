# React Assessment Task

## Overview

This project is a simple React application that demonstrates how to filter a data table based on multiple criteria using dynamic checkboxes and a text input. The styling is done using Tailwind CSS to provide a modern, responsive design.

## Features

- **Dynamic Filtering**: Filter data based on city, category, type, and active status using checkboxes.
- **Text Search**: Filter data by name using a text input.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive user interface.
